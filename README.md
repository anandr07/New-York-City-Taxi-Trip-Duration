Data Mining project

The research topic that our team has chosen is predicting the total ride duration of taxi trips in New York city.In cities like New york where the traffic is high and the distance between the destinations is short, everyone wants to reach their respective destinations as soon as possible.
The dependent variable in this research is “trip_duration” which is the duration of the trip in seconds.There are 10 independent variables or features which we will use in our hypothesis to generate our predictions.
